### 3.4. Search Strategy {#search-strategy}

*   Describe the search strategy approach (e.g., combination of MeSH/subject headings and free-text terms).
*   Provide an example of the full search strategy for at least one database (or state it will be provided in an appendix).
*   Mention the use of any filters (e.g., for study design).

### 3.5. Study Selection {#study-selection}

*   Describe the process for screening titles/abstracts and full texts (e.g., independently by two reviewers).
*   Explain how disagreements will be resolved (e.g., discussion, third reviewer).
*   Mention the use of screening software (if any).
*   State that a PRISMA flow diagram will be provided.

### 3.6. Data Extraction {#data-extraction}

*   Describe the data extraction process (e.g., using a standardized form, independently by two reviewers).
*   Explain how disagreements will be resolved.
*   List the key data items to be extracted:
    *   Study characteristics (e.g., author, year, country, design, setting, funding source).
    *   Participant characteristics (e.g., sample size, age, sex, baseline severity, diagnostic criteria).
    *   Intervention and comparator details (e.g., type, dose, duration, frequency, co-interventions).
    *   Outcome data (e.g., number of events, mean, SD, N per group for each outcome at relevant time points).

*   Specify the tool to be used for assessing risk of bias in individual studies (e.g., Cochrane RoB 2 for RCTs).
*   Describe the assessment process (e.g., independently by two reviewers, resolution of disagreements).
*   Explain how the risk of bias assessments will be used in the analysis (e.g., sensitivity analysis, informing certainty of evidence).

### 3.8. Data Synthesis {#data-synthesis}

#### 3.8.1. Pairwise Meta-Analysis (if applicable) {#pairwise-meta-analysis}

*   Describe if standard pairwise meta-analyses will be performed for direct comparisons before NMA.
*   Specify the effect measure (e.g., Odds Ratio (OR), Risk Ratio (RR) for dichotomous; Mean Difference (MD), Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) for continuous).

### 3.11. Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses {#sensitivity-and-subgroup-analyses}

*   List planned sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the findings (e.g., excluding studies with high risk of bias, excluding studies with specific participant characteristics, using alternative statistical models).
