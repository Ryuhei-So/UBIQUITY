To enable PROSPERO to focus on COVID-19 submissions, this registration record has undergone basic automated checks for eligibility and is published exactly as submitted. PROSPERO has never provided peer review, and usual checking by the PROSPERO team does not endorse content. Therefore, automatically published records should be treated as any other PROSPERO registration. Further detail is provided here.

REVIEW TITLE AND BASIC DETAILS
Review title
Initial treatment choices for insomnia disorder in adults: a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis

Review objectives
What are the long-term comparative efficacy and acceptability of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, pharmacotherapy, and their combination when used as the initial treatment for insomnia disorder in adults?

Keywords
cbt-i, hypnotic, insomnia, network meta-analysis
SEARCHING AND SCREENING
Searches
We will carry out a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, CENTRAL and PsycINFO. We will use a combination of index and free terms of psychological treatments and insomnia with filters for randomized clinical trials. We will also search WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We will impose no date, language or publication status restriction.

Study design
We will include all randomized controlled trials that compared CBT-I, pharmacotherapy and their combinations against each other. Cluster randomized trials will be included in meta-analyses in accordance with the Cochrane handbook recommendation. (Higgins et al., 2022) If the intra-cluster correlation coefficient is not clearly reported, we assume it to be 0.05.(Lin et al., 2018)

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Condition or domain being studied
insomnia

Population
We will include studies of patients of both genders aged 18 years or older with insomnia either diagnosed according to formal diagnostic criteria (such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the International Classification of Diseases or the International Classification of Sleep Disorders) or judged so by clinical experts (e.g. presence of significant symptoms). The criteria need to include significant distress or daytime impairment.

Intervention(s) or exposure(s)
We regard CBT-I as a psychotherapy involving any one of the following effective components: cognitive restructuring, third wave components (mindfulness and acceptance and commitment therapy), sleep restriction or stimulus control.(Furukawa et al., 2023) We will include drugs that were proven to be effective in the recent NMA. (benzodiazepines, doxylamine, eszopiclone, lemborexant, seltorexant, suvorexant, trazodone, zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone) (De_Crescenzo et al., 2022)

Comparator(s) or control(s)
CBT-I, pharmacotherapy, and their combinations against each other

OUTCOMES TO BE ANALYSED
Main outcomes
Efficacy at long-term follow-up. (Remission defined as reaching a satisfactory state at endpoint measured by any validated self-reported scale. Dichotomous. Longest follow-up between 3 to 12 months)

Measures of effect
We will use odds ratio

Additional outcomes
2. Acceptability: dropouts for any reason at long-term follow-up (dichotomous)
3. Sleep diary measures at long-term follow-up (continuous)
3.1. Sleep efficiency at long-term follow-up (SE, %)
3.2. Total sleep time at long-term follow-up (TST, minutes)
3.3. Sleep latency at long-term follow-up (SL, minutes)
3.4. Wake after sleep onset at long-term follow-up (WASO, minutes)
4. Efficacy at long-term follow-up (continuous)
5. Efficacy at post-treatment: remission defined as reaching a satisfactory state at endpoint measured by any validated self-reported scale (dichotomous)
6. Acceptability: dropouts for any reason at post-treatment (dichotomous)
7. Sleep diary measures at post-treatment (continuous)
7.1. Sleep efficiency at post-treatment (SE, %)
7.2. Total sleep time at post-treatment (TST, minutes)
7.3. Sleep latency at post-treatment (SL, minutes)
7.4. Wake after sleep onset at post-treatment (WASO, minutes)
8. Efficacy at post-treatment (continuous)

Measures of effect
We will use odds ratio for dichotomous outcomes, mean difference for continuous outcomes expressed in minutes and percent, and standardized mean difference for efficacy (continuous)

DATA COLLECTION PROCESS
Data extraction (selection and coding)
Two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts of all the potential studies we identify as a result of the search and code them as ‘retrieve’ or ‘do not retrieve’. We will retrieve the full text study reports/publications and two review authors will independently screen the full text and identify studies for inclusion and identify and record reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies. We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third reviewer. We will identify publications from the same study so that each study rather than each report is the unit of analysis in the review. We will record the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram.

Risk of bias (quality) assessment
We will use Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool (RoB2) (Sterne et al., 2019) to assess the risk of bias of the primary outcome. We will report the inter-rater agreement in terms of percentage agreement and kappa.

PLANNED DATA SYNTHESIS
Strategy for data synthesis
We will examine transitivity, an important underlying assumption of the network meta-analysis model, by creating a table of important trial and patient characteristics to see if potential effect modifiers (publication year, mean age, baseline severity) are similarly distributed among treatment comparisons. If we deem transitivity to be a plausible assumption, we will proceed with performing a network meta-analysis. Given the expected clinical and methodological heterogeneity of treatment effects among the studies, we will use the random-effects model, assuming a common heterogeneity parameter across the network.
Lack of transitivity may manifest as inconsistency in the network, in case there are closed loops. We will check for consistency using by comparing direct and indirect estimates and using global consistency test (design-by-treatment)(White et al., 2012). If the prerequisites of network meta-analysis are not met, or in case of large unexplained inconsistency, we will only present direct (i.e. from pairwise meta-analyses) and indirect evidence for each treatment comparison.
We will perform all analyses in R using netmeta package(Rücker et al., 2020) to conduct network meta-analysis and meta package(Balduzzi et al., 2019) to assess the reporting bias.

Analysis of subgroups or subsets
Sensitivity analyses
1. Excluding studies without formal diagnosis of insomnia
2. Excluding studies focusing on patients with comorbidities (both physical and psychological)
3. Excluding studies with overall high dropout rate (20% or more)
4. Excluding studies at high overall risk of bias
