## Review Title and Basic Details

### Review Title
Psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination in the treatment of major depression in adults: a network meta-analysis

### Review Objectives
What are the relative effects of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination for the treatment of adult depression?

### Keywords
Antidepressant medication, Cognitive behavior therapy, Major depression, Network meta-analysis, Psychotherapy, SSRI, TCA

## Searching and Screening

### Searches
We will use an existing database of randomised trials of psychotherapy for adult depression. The methods, including the searches (including full details on the search, which is regularly updated on a yearly basis) have been described in a separate paper (Cuijpers P, Reijnders M, Karyotaki M. Psychological treatment of depression: An updated meta-analytic database of randomized trials. Submitted).  
PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched.

### Study Design
We will include only randomised trials.

## Eligibility Criteria

### Condition or Domain Being Studied
Unipolar major depressive disorders.

### Population
- **Inclusion:** Any adult population with unipolar major depressive disorders.  
- **Exclusion:** Inpatients, adolescents, children.

### Intervention(s) or Exposure(s)
Psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination in the treatment of major depression in adults.  
We have defined psychotherapy according to the following definition (Campbell et al., 2013): “Psychotherapy is the informed and intentional application of clinical methods and interpersonal stances derived from established psychological principles for the purpose of assisting people to modify their behaviors, cognitions, emotions, and/or other personal characteristics in directions that the participants deem desirable.” We allowed different treatment formats, including individual, group, telephone, guided self-help (through the internet or not), and couple therapy.  
Pharmacotherapy includes any type of antidepressant, including SSRIs, TCAs, SNRIs and others.

### Comparator(s) or Control(s)
In the main analyses of the network meta-analysis, we will group psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and their combination in different nodes. We will also include studies comparing combined treatment or psychotherapy with pill placebo, as well as studies comparing combined treatment or psychotherapy with the combination of psychotherapy with pill placebo.

### Context
Patients with depressive disorders from any setting will be included.

## Outcomes to be Analysed

### Main Outcomes
Response, defined as a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms.

### Measures of Effect
We will include response rates as reported in the studies.  
Outcome measures will be included in the following order: 
1. Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HAMD) 
2. MADRS 
3. Any other reported clinician-rated outcome instrument 
4. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) 
5. Beck Depression Inventory -II (BDI-II) 
6. PHQ-9 
7. Any other self-report instrument.  
If the response rate (50% reduction after treatment) is not reported, we will use the method of Furukawa et al. (2006) to estimate the response rate.  
We will also include remission rates (as defined as scoring below a cut-off on a depression scale, according to the definition provided in the study), as well as standardised mean differences (Hedges' g).  
We will also include acceptability of the treatments, defined as study drop-out for any reason.

### Additional Outcomes
Response rates at follow-up.  
Follow-up periods are categorised as follows: 
- Between 6 and 12 months after randomisation 
- Between 12 and 24 months after randomisation 
- Longer than 24 months after randomisation.  
For studies reporting data at follow-up, we will also examine the treatment received during follow-up (e.g., continued treatment, no treatment). If patients are randomised again after treatment to specific maintenance treatments, these studies will not be included in the analyses at follow-up. Analyses will be conducted for the last follow-up of all studies reporting a follow-up longer than 6 months, and separately for each category (if there are enough studies available).

### Measures of Effect
The main analyses will examine the effects of treatment at post-test (when psychotherapy ends), but we will examine time to follow-up as a predictor in the meta-regression analyses.

## Data Collection Process

### Data Extraction (Selection and Coding)
The searches and selection of studies for inclusion will be carried out by two independent reviewers (PC and EK).  
We will record and rate the following characteristics of the studies:
- Target group (adults or more specific target groups, such as women with postpartum depression, older adults, patients with comorbid general medical disorders)
- Chronic and treatment resistant depression (versus any depression)
- Type of psychotherapy (according to the definitions given in the description of our database; Cuijpers et al., 2018)
- Therapy format (individual, group, other/mixed)
- Number of psychotherapy sessions
- Type of antidepressants; this will be collapsed into the categories of SSRI, SNRI, TCA, other antidepressant, other treatment with antidepressants (this category includes studies with antidepressant treatment according to specified protocols, and also studies in which the clinician decides which antidepressants are given to the patients, without any detailed information about the antidepressants prescribed)
- Dose of antidepressants
- Type of recruitment (from the community; only clinical samples; other recruitment)
- Country where the study was conducted (North-America, Europe, other country).

### Risk of Bias (Quality) Assessment
We will use four items of the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool: the adequate generation of allocation sequence; the concealment of allocation to conditions; the prevention of knowledge of the allocated intervention (masking of assessors); and dealing with incomplete outcome data (this was assessed as positive when intention-to-treat analyses were conducted, meaning that all randomised patients were included in the analyses). Items are rated as positive (no risk of bias) or negative (high or unclear risk of bias).

## Planned Data Synthesis

### Strategy for Data Synthesis
We will first conduct pairwise meta-analyses comparing the treatments, using a random effects pooling model. As a test of homogeneity of effect sizes, we will calculate the I² statistic. We will calculate 95% confidence intervals around I² (Ioannidis, Patsopoulos, & Evangelou, 2007), using the non-central χ²-based approach within the heterogi module for Stata (Orsini, Bottai, Higgins, & Buchan, 2006). We will test for publication bias with Egger’s test of the intercept to quantify the bias captured by the funnel plot and to test whether it was significant.  
The comparative effectiveness will be evaluated using the network meta-analysis (NMA) methodology via combining direct and indirect evidence for all relative treatment effects. At first, we will summarize the geometry of the network of evidence using network plots (Hutton, et al., 2015). Second, the NMA for assessing the comparative efficacy or acceptability will be conducted using the contrast-based, NMA methods (Salanti et al., 2008). The multivariate random effect models (Salanti, 2012) will be adopted to examine it. Comparative relative risks (RR) and standardized mean differences (SMD) will be reported with their 95% confidence intervals and 95% prediction intervals. The ranking of treatment formats will be estimated according to the “surface under the cumulative ranking” (SUCRA), based on the estimated multivariate random effects models (Hutton, et al., 2015).  
In order to examine the transitivity assumption (a primary requisite of network meta-analysis), we will first make a table of important trial characteristics of the studies described earlier.

### Analysis of Subgroups or Subsets
The statistical examination of transitivity assumption will be conducted by checking the consistency of the network using tests of local and global inconsistency. The local inconsistency tests evaluate the loop inconsistency of all the triangle loops on the network (Chaimani et al., 2013). If any relevant sources of bias are found, sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess how these factors influence the overall results, through the selection of studies with low risk of bias, with SSRIs only, and with CBT only. When substantive small study effects are noted, we will implement meta-regression analyses to evaluate their influences involving the study-specific variances as a covariate (Chaimani and Salanti, 2012).  
Further, we will conduct a multivariate meta-regression analysis to examine possible sources of heterogeneity (with the same variables that were also used to examine the transitivity assumption).  
All analyses will be conducted in Stata/SE 14.2 for Mac, except the meta-regression analyses examining small sample bias, which will be conducted in OpenBUGS 3.2.3 (if they are conducted).
