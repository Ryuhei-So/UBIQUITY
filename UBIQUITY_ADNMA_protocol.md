- We plan to conduct this NMA based on the methods and results reported in a Cochrane review (Kaner, 2018).
- We will include only trials conducted in primary care settings that do not focus solely on adolescents or young adults.
- We can extract data from 22 primary care trials from Kaner's review.
    - Kaner et al. synthesized 34 trials conducted in primary care (k=22), emergency departments (k=10), and college health care centers (k=2) (Schaus, 2009 and Fleming, 2010).
    - We may need to extract data by reviewing the original articles of some trials.
- We need to perform an updated search on databases from September 2017 onward, followed by screening and data extraction.
- We need to assess all trials to be included in our NMA using RoB2 because Kaner et al. used RoB1 in theri review.

## 1. BACKGROUND {#background}

Hazardous drinking pose a global public health challenge, contributing to both physical and mental health disorders and resulting in substantial social and economic losses. (WHO, 2019) Because primary care settings, 4–29% of patients may engage in hazardous drinking, these settings can be an ideal place for early intervention. (Reid 1999) To make the most of this opportunity, researchers have developed several brief interventions (BIs), and showed their effectiveness in primary care settings. (Kaner 2018)

However, typical BIs may not be brief enough to be feasible in busy clinical environments. BIs studied in primary care settings require a median duration of 25 minutes and can total up to 175 minutes. (Kaner 2018) These time constraints pose a major barrier to their implementation. (Johnson, 2011 and Isted, 2015) Ultra-Brief Interventions (UBIs), which can be conducted in a much shorter time, can be a more practical option for implementation in such settings.

Two large pragmatic trials have shown varied results regarding UBI's effectiveness for hazardous drinking in primary care. The SIPS trial in the UK found no statistical difference between UBI and BIs in 5 minutes and in 20 minutes that were expected to be effective. (Kaner, 2014) Furthermore, a secondary analysis of SIPS trial suggests a high probability of no difference. (Dienes, 2018) However, the EASY study in Japan found no statistical difference between UBI and no additional intervention. (So, 2025)

<!-- This raises two critical research questions: Is there a dose-response relationship between the intensity of BIs and their effectiveness on hazardous drinking? And, are UBI effective compared to no additional intervention at all? To Address these questions, We will conduct systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to comprehensively evaluate the relative effectiveness of different BI intensities, providing insights into their potential implementation in clinical practice. --> 

## 2. REVIEW QUESTION(S) {#review-questions}

*   **Primary Research Question:**
Is UBI for hazardous drinking effective compared to no additional intervention at all? 

*   **Secondary Research Questions:**
Is there a dose-response relationship between the intensity of BIs and their effectiveness on hazardous drinking? 

## 3. METHODS {#methods}

### 3.1. Protocol and Registration {#protocol-and-registration}

*   This protocol adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension statement for Network Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-NMA). (Hutton et al., 2015)
*   We will prospectively register this protocol on osf.io.

### 3.2. Eligibility Criteria {#eligibility-criteria}

#### 3.2.1. Study Designs {#study-designs}

*   **Included:** RCTs and cluster RCTs is eligible for inclusion. We will also include auasi-experimental studies.
*   **Excluded:** Observational studies.

#### 3.2.2. Participants {#participants}

*   **Included:** Studies involving individuals identified as having hazardous drinking (e.g., hazardous or harmful drinking, or alcohol use disorder as determined by screening tools) in primary care departments.

*   **Excluded:** Studies that focus solely on individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder or alcohol dependence, as well as studies that include individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder or alcohol dependence.

This study will not include participants recruited in emergency departments and trauma centers, although such participants were included in Kaner 2018.

#### 3.2.3. Interventions {#interventions}

Interventions will be categorized into the following levels of intensity:

1.  **Ultra-Brief Intervention: UBI）**: UBI involves the provision of written information regarding alcohol consumption, risks, and resources. It may include minimal verbal feedback lasting less than five minutes, without any structured advice or counseling elements, and does not provide individual feedback beyond screening results.

2.  **Brief Intervention: BI**: We defined BI in this NMA as a structured intervention lasting at leaset 5 minutes that includes direct feedback about drinking and its risks. Some BIs may be advice-based and other BIs may be counselling-based utilizes motivational interviewing techniques or cognitive behavioral approaches.

> **Reference from Kaner 2018:** The following information serves as a reference. Conditions 1, 2, and 3 are categorized as control conditions, while conditions 4 and 5 are included under UBI.
> 1. screening only; 
> 2. screening and assessment only; 
> 3. usual care - this was usually not described further but was assumed to be care for the presenting condition or usual advice about alcohol consumption; 
> 4. general health advice or minimal advice about alcohol, comprising general health information or very limited alcohol-related information which often included an instruction to cut down drinking; 
> 5. a leaflet with either general health and lifestyle advice or more specific information about the risks of hazardous alcohol consumption.

#### 3.2.4. Comparators {#comparators}

1.  **No Intervention Beyond Treatment as Usual / Screening or Assessment Only**: This includes no specific intervention targeting alcohol, consisting solely of screening or assessment, and providing usual care in primary care settings.

#### 3.2.5. Outcomes {#outcomes}

*   **Outcomes:**
In alignment with the outcomes defined in Kaner 2018, we set the following measures to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on hazardous drinkking:

*   **Primary Outcome:**
1. Self-reported or other reports indicating the quantity of alcohol consumed (e.g., number of drinks per week).
<!-- 
// NMAなのでOutcomeは少なくする。
 *   **Secondary Outcomes:**
1. Self-reported or other reports indicating the frequency of binge drinking episodes (e.g., number of binges per week).
// 1. Alcohol-related problems measured using scales similar to the AUDIT.
// 2. Incidence of alcohol-related harm experienced by drinkers or others affected (e.g., assessed through questionnaires like the drinking problems index).
// 3. Changes in laboratory markers associated with reduced alcohol consumption (e.g., serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV)).
// 4. Measures of patient satisfaction.
// 5. Health-related quality of life indicators.
// 6. Economic evaluations, including the utilization of health services.

### 3.7. Risk of Bias Assessment {#risk-of-bias-assessment}

*   Two review authors will independently assess the risk of bias in the primary outcome using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool (RoB2) (Sterne et al., 2019). We will report inter-rater agreement as a percentage and kappa. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. 

### 3.8. Data Synthesis {#data-synthesis}
<!-- 
 #### 3.8.1. Pairwise Meta-Analysis (if applicable) {#pairwise-meta-analysis}
// 
 *   Standard pairwise meta-analyses using a random-effects model will be performed for direct comparisons with sufficient data (e.g., >= 2 studies) prior to NMA, primarily to inform the assessment of heterogeneity and inconsistency.
 *   Effect measure for continuous outcomes: Mean Difference (MD) in grams/week. If different scales are used that cannot be converted, Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) might be considered, but MD is preferred.

 If any relevant sources of bias are found, sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess how these factors influence the overall results, through the selection of studies with low risk of bias, with SSRIs only, and with CBT only. When substantive small study effects are noted, we will implement meta-regression analyses to evaluate their influences involving the study-specific variances as a covariate (Chaimani and Salanti, 2012).

Further, we will conduct a multivariate meta-regression analysis to examine possible sources of heterogeneity (with the same variables that were also used to examine the transitivity assumption).  

We will conduct all analyses in R, using the *netmeta* package (Rücker et al., 2020) for the network meta-analysis and the *meta* package (Balduzzi et al., 2019) to evaluate reporting bias.

#### 3.8.1. Assessment of Transitivity {#assessment-of-transitivity}

*   The transitivity assumption implies that indirect comparisons are valid. We will assess transitivity by comparing the distribution of potential effect modifiers (e.g., mean age, sex, baseline severity, study setting, publication year) across studies grouped by direct comparisons. 

#### 3.8.3. Network Meta-Analysis {#network-meta-analysis}

*   If we find transitivity to be a reasonable assumption, we will perform NMA using the `netmeta` package in R. (Rücker et al., 2020)
*   The network geometry will be visualized using a network plot showing the nodes (interventions) and edges (available direct comparisons).
*   We will present results as MDs (or SMDs if necessary) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) relative to a common comparator (likely 'No Intervention'). We will create league tables presenting all pairwise comparisons.

#### 3.8.4. Assessment of Inconsistency {#assessment-of-inconsistency}

*   Statistical inconsistency (disagreement between direct and indirect evidence) will be evaluated globally using the design-by-treatment interaction model using the `netmeta` package. (Rücker et al., 2020)
*   If significant inconsistency is detected, we will explore potential sources. If we encounter unexplained inconsistency, we will restrict our presentation to direct and indirect evidence for each treatment comparison.

### 3.9. Assessment of Reporting Biases {#assessment-of-reporting-biases}

*   Potential small-study effects and publication bias will be assessed visually using comparison-adjusted funnel plots using the `netmeta` package. (Rücker et al., 2020) if the network contains a sufficient number of studies (e.g., ≥ 10 studies contributing to comparisons).

### 3.10. Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) {#cinema}
We will assess the certainty of evidence in network estimates of the
primary outcome using CINeMA.(Nikolakopoulou et al., 2020)
*   We will assess the certainty of evidence for for the primary outcome  using the CINeMA framework (Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis) (Nikolakopoulou et al., 2020).

### 3.11. Sensitivity Analyses {#sensitivity-analyses}

*   **Planned Sensitivity Analyses:**
    *   Excluding studies judged to be at high overall risk of bias.
    *   Excluding studies with overall high dropout rate (20% or more).
