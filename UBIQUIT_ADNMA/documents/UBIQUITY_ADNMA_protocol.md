---

- We plan to conduct this NMA based on the methods and results reported in a Cochrane review (Kaner, 2018).
- We will include only trials conducted in primary care settings that do not focus solely on adolescents or young adults.
- We can extract data from 22 primary care trials from Kaner's review.
    - Kaner et al. synthesized 34 trials conducted in primary care (k=22), emergency departments (k=10), and college health care centers (k=2) (Schaus, 2009 and Fleming, 2010).
    - We may need to extract data by reviewing the original articles of some trials.
- We need to perform an updated search on databases from September 2017 onward, followed by screening and data extraction.
- We need to assess all trials to be included in our NMA using RoB2 because Kaner et al. used RoB1 in their review.

## 1. BACKGROUND {#background}

Hazardous drinking pose a global public health challenge, contributing to both physical and mental health disorders and resulting in substantial social and economic losses. (WHO, 2019) Because primary care settings, 4–29% of patients may engage in hazardous drinking, these settings can be an ideal place for early intervention. (Reid 1999) To make the most of this opportunity, researchers have developed several brief interventions (BIs), and showed their effectiveness in primary care settings. (Kaner 2018)

However, typical BIs may not be brief enough to be feasible in busy clinical environments. BIs studied in primary care settings require a median duration of 25 minutes and can total up to 175 minutes. (Kaner 2018) These time constraints pose a major barrier to their implementation. (Johnson, 2011 and Isted, 2015) Ultra-Brief Interventions (UBIs), which can be conducted in a much shorter time, can be a more practical option for implementation in such settings.

Two large pragmatic trials have shown varied results regarding UBI's effectiveness for hazardous drinking in primary care. The SIPS trial in the UK found no statistical difference between UBI and BIs in 5 minutes and in 20 minutes that were expected to be effective. (Kaner, 2014) Furthermore, a secondary analysis of SIPS trial suggests a high probability of no difference. (Dienes, 2018) However, the EASY study in Japan found no statistical difference between UBI and no additional intervention. (So, 2025)

<!-- This raises two critical research questions: Is there a dose-response relationship between the intensity of BIs and their effectiveness on hazardous drinking? And, are UBI effective compared to no additional intervention at all? To Address these questions, We will conduct systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to comprehensively evaluate the relative effectiveness of different BI intensities, providing insights into their potential implementation in clinical practice. --> 

## 2. REVIEW QUESTION(S) {#review-questions}

*   **Primary Research Question:**
Are Ultra-Brief Interventions (UBI-minimal and UBI-feedback) for hazardous drinking effective compared to no additional intervention? Specifically, we will evaluate:
   1. UBI-minimal vs. No Intervention
   2. UBI-feedback vs. No Intervention

## 3. METHODS {#methods}

### 3.1. Protocol and Registration {#protocol-and-registration}

*   This protocol adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension statement for Network Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-NMA). (Hutton et al., 2015)
*   We will prospectively register this protocol on osf.io.

### 3.2. Eligibility Criteria {#eligibility-criteria}

This network meta-analysis focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of Ultra-Brief Interventions (UBIs) for hazardous drinking compared to no intervention and Brief Interventions (BIs). The scope is specifically limited to primary care settings. Studies focused solely on adolescents, young adults, or individuals primarily seeking treatment for alcohol dependence will be excluded.

#### 3.2.1. Study Designs {#study-designs}

*   **Included:** Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs are eligible for inclusion.
*   **Excluded:** Observational studies.

#### 3.2.2. Participants {#participants}

*   **Included:** Studies involving individuals identified as having hazardous drinking (e.g., hazardous or harmful drinking, or alcohol use disorder as determined by screening tools) in primary care departments.

*   **Excluded:** Studies that focus solely on individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder or alcohol dependence, as well as studies that include individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder or alcohol dependence.

This study will not include participants recruited in emergency departments and trauma centers, although such participants were included in Kaner 2018.

#### 3.2.3. Interventions {#interventions}

Interventions will be categorized into the following levels:

1.  **No Intervention**: See Comparators section (3.2.4).
2.  **Ultra-Brief Intervention (Minimal): UBI-minimal**: Provision of written information (e.g., leaflet) regarding alcohol consumption, risks, and resources, *without* any accompanying verbal feedback or advice beyond screening results.
3.  **Ultra-Brief Intervention (Feedback): UBI-feedback**: Provision of written information *plus* minimal verbal feedback or advice lasting less than five minutes (e.g., brief feedback on screening results, general health advice, instruction to cut down). This does not include structured counseling elements.
4.  **Brief Intervention: BI**: Structured intervention lasting at least 5 minutes that includes direct feedback about drinking and its risks. This may be advice-based or counselling-based (e.g., utilizing motivational interviewing techniques or cognitive behavioral approaches).

> **Reference from Kaner 2018:** The following information shows the mapping of conditions described in Kaner 2018 (lines 75-80 in the original protocol v0.1) to our categories:
> 1. screening only -> **No Intervention**
> 2. screening and assessment only -> **No Intervention**
> 3. usual care -> **No Intervention**
> 4. general health advice or minimal advice about alcohol -> **UBI-feedback**
> 5. a leaflet only -> **UBI-minimal**

Table 1 summarizes the mapping between the intervention/control conditions described in Kaner 2018 and the categories used in this NMA.

| Category in this NMA | Conditions from Kaner 2018 (Ref: Protocol v0.1 L75-80) | Description                                                                     |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No Intervention      | 1, 2, 3                                                | Screening only; Screening & assessment only; Usual care                         |
| UBI-minimal          | 5                                                      | Leaflet only (general health or alcohol info)                                   |
| UBI-feedback         | 4                                                      | General health advice or minimal alcohol advice (verbal, <5 min)                |
| BI                   | (Active interventions in Kaner 2018)                   | Structured intervention ≥ 5 min with feedback (Advice-based or Counselling-based) |

*Note: Our BI category corresponds to the active brief interventions evaluated in Kaner 2018.*

#### 3.2.4. Comparators {#comparators}

1.  **No Intervention Beyond Treatment as Usual / Screening or Assessment Only**: This includes no specific intervention targeting alcohol, consisting solely of screening or assessment, and providing usual care in primary care settings.

#### 3.2.5. Outcomes {#outcomes}

*   **Outcomes:**
In alignment with the outcomes defined in Kaner 2018, we set the following measures to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions on hazardous drinkking:

*   **Primary Outcome:**
1. Self-reported or other reports indicating the quantity of alcohol consumed (e.g., grams per week). For the primary analysis, we will use data from the longest follow-up time point reported within the range of 6 to 12 months for each study.
*   **Secondary Outcomes:**
    1. Self-reported or other reports indicating the frequency of binge drinking episodes (e.g., number of binges per week).
#### 3.2.6. Report Characteristics {#report-characteristics}

*   We applied no restrictions on language, publication status, or year of publication.

### 3.3. Information Sources {#information-sources}

*   **Electronic Databases:** 
The search strategy for this systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) will be based on the searches conducted in the Kaner 2018 Cochrane review. We will utilize the data reported in Kaner 2018 for the following databases, except for the Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (ETOH), which is no longer available. For all other databases listed below, we will conduct updated searches to include records registered after the search periods reported in Kaner 2018, specifically from September 2017 onwards:

### 3.4. Search Strategy {#search-strategy}

*   **Search Strategy:** 
The search strategy will follow the methodology reported in the Cochrane review (Kaner 2018). Detailed search strategies for each database are provided in Appendix A.

### 3.5. Study Selection {#study-selection}

*   **Screening:** We will independently screen titles and abstracts with two review authors. We will then retrieve and assess the full texts of potentially eligible studies against the eligibility criteria.
*   **Disagreement Resolution:** We will resolve disagreements at both stages through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer.
*   **Software:** We may use screening software (e.g., Rayyan).
*   **Reporting:** We will provide a PRISMA flow diagram that documents the study selection process.

### 3.6. Data Extraction {#data-extraction}

*   **Process:** Two review authors will independently extract data using a standardized data extraction form (see Appendix B for key items).
*   **Disagreement Resolution:** Discrepancies will be resolved by discussion or consultation with a third reviewer.
*   **Data Items:**
    *   **Study characteristics:** We will extract name of the study, author, year of publication, country, study site (single or multi-center), setting, study design (individual or cluster RCT), analysis set (ITT or not), and funding source.
    *   **Participant characteristics:** We will extract mean age, noumber of women, baseline alcohol consumption, baseline severity of alcohol-related problems (AUDIT-C, AUDIT, etc.)
    *   **Intervention/Comparator details:** We will extract specific contents of materials (if provided), Specific components of interventions (including presence/absence and nature of verbal feedback/advice for UBI), duration/time spent, number of sessions, provider type (physicians, nurses, etc.), theoretical basis (if stated). Assignment to the four categories (No Intervention, UBI-minimal, UBI-feedback, and BI).
    *   **Outcome data:** We will extract the number of participants randomized to each arm, the number of participants assessed, the number of analyzed, the mean, standard deviation, and follow-up timepoint for the outcomes. When only change from baseline to endpoint is reported for the outcomes, we will use it instead of endpoint mean.
    *   **Missing Data:** We will contact authors of included studies for missing data. If unavailable, statistical methods for estimation (e.g., calculating SD from standard error, confidence intervals, or p-values).

<!-- imputationは考えなくて良い？ -->

### 3.7. Risk of Bias Assessment {#risk-of-bias-assessment}

*   Two review authors will independently assess the risk of bias in the primary outcome using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool (RoB2) (Sterne et al., 2019). We will report inter-rater agreement as a percentage and kappa. Disagreements will be resolved by discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. 

### 3.8. Data Synthesis {#data-synthesis}

We will conduct all analyses in R, using the *netmeta* package (Rücker et al., 2020) for the network meta-analysis and the *meta* package (Balduzzi et al., 2019) to evaluate reporting bias.

#### 3.8.1. Assessment of Transitivity {#assessment-of-transitivity}

*   The transitivity assumption implies that indirect comparisons are valid. We will assess transitivity by comparing the distribution of potential effect modifiers across studies grouped by direct comparisons. Key potential modifiers we will examine include: overall risk of bias judgment (from RoB2 assessment), mean participant age (given potential age-related effect heterogeneity suggested by So, 2025), baseline alcohol consumption level or severity score (e.g., AUDIT score), participant sex distribution, study setting (if variable beyond primary care), and publication year.

#### 3.8.2. Network Meta-Analysis {#network-meta-analysis}

*   If we find transitivity to be a reasonable assumption, we will perform NMA using the `netmeta` package in R. (Rücker et al., 2020) We will primarily use a random-effects model for the NMA, as implemented in the `netmeta` package, assuming potential heterogeneity between studies.
*   The network geometry will be visualized using a network plot showing the nodes (No Intervention, UBI-minimal, UBI-feedback, BI) and edges (available direct comparisons).
*   For the primary outcome (alcohol consumption), we will synthesize data using Mean Differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), expressed in grams per week (g/week). If studies report consumption in other units (e.g., standard drinks, units), we will convert these to g/week based on the definition provided in each study. If the definition is unclear, we will attempt to contact authors or use a standard conversion factor based on the study's country if appropriate and clearly documented. Results will be presented relative to a common comparator (likely 'No Intervention'). We will create league tables presenting all pairwise comparisons.

#### 3.8.3. Assessment of Inconsistency {#assessment-of-inconsistency}

*   Statistical inconsistency (disagreement between direct and indirect evidence) will be evaluated globally using the design-by-treatment interaction model using the `netmeta` package. (Rücker et al., 2020)
        *   If significant inconsistency is detected, we will explore potential sources using multivariate meta-regression analysis to examine possible sources of heterogeneity (with the same variables that were also used to examine the transitivity assumption). If we encounter unexplained inconsistency, we will restrict our presentation to direct and indirect evidence for each treatment comparison.

### 3.9. Assessment of Reporting Biases {#assessment-of-reporting-biases}

*   Potential small-study effects and publication bias will be assessed visually using comparison-adjusted funnel plots using the `netmeta` package. (Rücker et al., 2020) if the network contains a sufficient number of studies (e.g., ≥ 10 studies contributing to comparisons). When substantive small study effects are noted, we will implement meta-regression analyses to evaluate their influences involving the study-specific variances as a covariate (Chaimani and Salanti, 2012).

### 3.10. Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) {#cinema}
We will assess the certainty of evidence in network estimates of the
primary outcome using CINeMA.(Nikolakopoulou et al., 2020)
*   We will assess the certainty of evidence for for the primary outcome  using the CINeMA framework (Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis) (Nikolakopoulou et al., 2020).

### 3.11. Sensitivity Analyses {#sensitivity-analyses}

If any relevant sources of bias are found, sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess how these factors influence the overall results.

*   **Planned Sensitivity Analyses:**
    *   Excluding studies judged to be at high overall risk of bias.
    *   Excluding studies with overall high dropout rate (20% or more).
    *   **Subgroup analysis by follow-up duration:** We will conduct subgroup analyses based on follow-up time points, categorized as approximately 3 months (12 weeks), 6 months (24 weeks), 9 months (36 weeks), and 12 months (48 weeks). Each study's reported time point will be assigned to the nearest category. If a time point falls exactly between two categories, it will be assigned to the longer duration category.
    *   **Excluding potential outliers:** If the inconsistency assessment identifies specific studies contributing significantly to inconsistency (potential outliers), we will conduct a sensitivity analysis excluding these studies.
